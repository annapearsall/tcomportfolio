            <div class="bioP"><h1>Hello there!</h1>
            <p>I'm Anna, and I am about to graduate from Eastern Washington University with my Bachelor's of Arts in Technical Communication and a minor in Creative Writing. I have experience with a variety of technical writing documents, including instructions, grant writing, technical editing, and web writing. I also have experience in web design and development.</p>
            <p>In my work, I have a great balance between my creative, thinking-big side, and my technical, attentive-to-detail side. I love working on projects that challenge me and push me to my limits. Web design in particular always excites me, motivates me, and can be daunting at times in the best way possible. I prefer short-term, contract-based work that grants me freedom to spontaneously go on adventures, like working summers in Southeast Alaska!</p>

                <a href="assets\icons.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="assets\icons.jpg" alt="preview of icons" class="thumbnail"></a>
                <p>For this project, I took my favorite movie and represented the story with four icons. I drew the layout and icons by hand with Micron Pens and a Tombow Dual Brush Pen marker. Here are the main skills I utilized:</p>

                    <li>Using symbolic imagery to represent a story</li>

                <p>For this project, I designed a set of icons using Adobe Illustrator. This challenged my ability to simplify shapes and use color in a purposeful and aesthetic manner. Here are the main skills I utilized:</p>

                    <li>Planning and brainstorming set</li>

                <p>For this project, I scanned high-quality images of a certain texture from an object. I then took colors and shapes from the texture and repeated them in a pattern. Here are the main skills I utilized:</p>
